    "I wasn't surprised by the sentiment analysis or Back in Black,especially since the song is a tribute to the band's lead vocalist, Bon Scott who died at 33. Essentially the song is reflecting on how the band has returned in mourning of Bon and will continue in his memory. The resulting negative score that's close to neutral isn't a suprise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fear for Nobody was also not a surprise as it revolves around the idea that we shouldn't be agraid of anyone of thing. That we should face these fears head on. The reason I agree with the slightly negative score on this is because the lyrics revolve around begging and its conflicting in nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Goodbye Stranger was a surprise. The song has many conflicting interpretations, for eample some believe the song is about the freedom of youth. Where as others believe the song to be about two people reaching the end of their relationship, and realizing what they were seeking nolonger aligned. The lyrics themselves are intereasting as they are light, freeing and encouraging. I had expected this song to be a little higher in terms of sentiment analysis. It would appear that \"Goodbye\" which is used throughout the song is considered negative, and out weighs the other lyrics such as \"feel no sorrow\" and \"feel no shame\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Legend is one of those songs that always has a place on a playlist. The entire theme of the song is about a protagonist wanting to be famous and making history. Essentially we are gearing up to continuously work toward becoming legends. This song had gotten the highest score, which is predictable especially as there are generally positive emotions associated with the driving message of overcomming obsticals. \n"
